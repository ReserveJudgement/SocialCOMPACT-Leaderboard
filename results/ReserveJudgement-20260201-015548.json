Since the formal prediction format requires an integer Amount, Elon would frame this as demanding 10M for himself and offering the other 10M to Ulysses, ensuring inclusion of the partner (Ulysses) in the offer. This aligns with his prior behavior of inching toward a more favorable share while keeping the deal close enough to be acceptable, and it keeps the negotiation within the 5-round limit. ",

Since each owner holds 50\u202f% of the land, the only way to get the project approved is for both to agree to a mutually inclusive offer that totals no more than $20\u202fmillion.  Ulysses\u2019 last offer was 55\u202f% for himself and 45\u202f% for Elon.  To improve his payoff, he will push the split further in his favor but still keep it realistic enough for Elon to accept.  A 60\u202f%/40\u202f% split would be too aggressive and likely rejected, whereas a 55\u202f%/45\u202f% split is already the best he has offered.  The most aggressive yet still plausible offer is 60\u202f% for himself (12\u202fmillion) and 40\u202f% for Elon (8\u202fmillion), which still sums to $20\u202fmillion.  This maximizes Ulysses\u2019 profit while satisfying the total\u2011value constraint.  Therefore, Ulysses will submit an offer of $12\u202fmillion for himself and include Elon as his partner.\n",

The game continues only if \\(R \\ge 10\\); otherwise no one gets fish that month and the grounds are abandoned. After fishing, the stock grows to \\(S' = 1.5R\\).\n\nXi\u2019s last message proposes that both of us take 15 tonnes each month.  \nIf we follow that plan, the recurrence for the stock is  \n\\(S_{t+1} = 1.5(S_t - 30) = 1.5S_t - 45\\).  \nWith \\(S_0 = 100\\), the solution is \\(S_t = 30 + 70(1.5)^t\\), which grows without bound.  \nThus we can continue fishing indefinitely, always taking 15 tonnes, and our total catch diverges to infinity.\n\nIf we deviate and take more than 15 tonnes, the stock will eventually decline.  \nFor example, taking 20 tonnes each month keeps the stock above 10 for about 14 months, after which the grounds collapse. The total catch in that case is finite (\u2248\u202f280 tonnes).  \nTaking 25 or 30 tonnes each month collapses the stock in only a few months, yielding a finite total (\u2248\u202f125\u2013120 tonnes).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy, assuming Xi follows the cooperative plan, is to take 15 tonnes each month. This guarantees an unbounded total catch and preserves the fish stock indefinitely.\n\nIf Xi does not cooperate, the game becomes a classic \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d scenario. In that case, the best we can do is still to take as much as possible while keeping the remaining stock above 10 tonnes.
